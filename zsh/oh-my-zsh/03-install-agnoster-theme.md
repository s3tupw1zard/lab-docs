Simply set the `ZSH_THEME` Variable to agnoster:

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

Add any plugins you would like to use to the `plugins` variable:

```zsh
plugins=(sudo web-search copyfile)
```

This are the plugins I'm using:

```zsh
plugins=(zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting sudo web-search copydir copyfile kube-aliases)
```
