## Enable WSL and VM-Platform features

You need to install WSL2. For this we enable WSL using the following powershell command. Remember here that powershell needs to be opened as administrator.

We enable the `Windows-Subsystem for Linux`-feature using the following command: 

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

And after that we enable the `Virtual Machine Platform`-feature using the following command:

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

## Download Linux Kernel Update Package

Now it's time to install the WSL2 Kernel update package.

Here's the link to the official Microsoft page of the WSL2 Kernel:
[WSL2 Kernel Update Package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package)

Or alternatively you can use this direct link:
[WSL2 Kernel Update Package Direct Link](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)

## Setting WSL2 as Default

After executing the downloaded msi package and installing the kernel update we need to set WSL2 as default:

```powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

## Note on Windows 11 24H2

I'm running Windows 11 24H2 on my local machine and I discovered that I couldn't install the above kernel update package. It seemed that on this Windows version the WSL2 is going to be installed after downloading and opening a WSL Distro from the Microsoft Store.

This is the output on my machine after executing `wsl --version` inside a elevated Powershell prompt:

```powershell
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> wsl --version
WSL-Version: 2.2.4.0
Kernelversion: 5.15.153.1-2
WSLg-Version: 1.0.61
MSRDC-Version: 1.2.5326
Direct3D-Version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore-Version: 10.0.26091.1-240325-1447.ge-release
Windows-Version: 10.0.26100.863
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32>
```

## Install a WSL Distro

Download Ubuntu 24.04 from the Microsoft Store.

## Base Installation

Just follow the guide from [[01-install-homebrew]] and [[02-install-needed-packages]].
